"Recombination and selection against introgressed DNA"
C Veller, NB Edelman, P Muralidhar, MA Nowak

The simulations in the paper were run in SLiM 3 (messerlab.org/slim), but the code has been updated to be compatible with SLiM 4 (these updates are administrative only).

In all cases, the loci (1,000 or 10,000) at which we track ancestry are spread evenly across the physical genome, as defined by the Human Reference Genome GRCh38.p11 and the Drosophila melanogaster reference genome Release 6.
Recombination rates between these loci are interpolated using the linkage maps produced by Kong et al. 2010 (doi.org/10.1038/nature09525) for humans and Comeron et al. 2012 (doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002905) for Drosophila melanogaster. These rates are inputted from the .txt files in the folder "LinkageMaps".

"additiveSelection_Autosomal_noNeutralLoci.slim" is the baseline code, which simulates the change in introgressed allele frequencies at 1,000 autosomal loci, at all of which the introgressed allele is deleterious. Can toggle human and D. melanogaster recombination processes.

"additiveSelection_Autosomal_withNeutralLoci.slim" adds to this baseline setup 10,000 neutral loci evenly spaced along the physical genome (autosomes), and tracks ancestry at both these and the selected loci.  Can toggle human and D. melanogaster recombination processes.

"additiveSelection_withSexChrom_withNeutralLoci.slim" adds sex chromosomes. Can toggle human and D. melanogaster recombination processes, as well as a stylized recombination process with ....

"additiveSelection_Autosomal_withNeutralLoci_trackEachLocus.slim" ... for correlation

"DMIs_Autosomal_withNeutralLoci.slim" ... DMIs
