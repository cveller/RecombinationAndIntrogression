"Recombination and selection against introgressed DNA"
C Veller, NB Edelman, P Muralidhar, MA Nowak

The simulations in the paper were run in SLiM 3 (messerlab.org/slim), but the code has been updated to be compatible with SLiM 4 (these updates are administrative only).

In all cases, the loci (1,000 or 10,000) at which we track ancestry are spread evenly across the physical genome, as defined by the Human Reference Genome GRCh38.p11 and the Drosophila melanogaster reference genome Release 6.
Recombination rates between these loci are interpolated using the linkage maps produced by Kong et al. 2010 (doi.org/10.1038/nature09525) for humans and Comeron et al. 2012 (doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002905) for Drosophila melanogaster. These rates are inputted from the .txt files in the folder "LinkageMaps".

"additiveSelection_Autosomal_noNeutralLoci.slim" is the baseline code, which simulates the change in introgressed allele frequencies at 1,000 autosomal loci, at all of which the introgressed allele is deleterious. Can toggle human and D. melanogaster recombination processes.

"additiveSelection_Autosomal_withNeutralLoci.slim" adds to this baseline setup 10,000 neutral loci evenly spaced along the physical genome (autosomes), and tracks ancestry at both these and the selected loci.  Can toggle human and D. melanogaster recombination processes.

"additiveSelection_withXChrom_noNeutralLoci.slim" adds an X chromosome to the baseline setup. Can toggle human and D. melanogaster recombination processes, as well as a stylized genome with one autosome and one X chromosome of equal size. For the stylized genome, each chromosome receives one recombination on average in females. The X does not recombine in males. Can toggle whether there is autosomal recombination in males (1 recombination on average) or not.

"additiveSelection_Autosomal_withNeutralLoci_trackEachLocus.slim" is the same as "additiveSelection_Autosomal_withNeutralLoci.slim", but the fraction of the introgressed allele at each of the 10,000 loci is outputted (generating very large output files) so that correlations between recombination rate and introgressed ancestry can be calculated for genomic windows of various sizes. In addition, the  fraction of the introgressed allele at each of the 1,000 selected loci is outputted, so that the decomposition in Eq. (17) of the paper can be calculated.

"DMISelection_Autosomal_withNeutralLoci.slim" simulates a scenario where fitness reductions occur via Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities across 500 locus pairs. There are 10,000 loci in total, and introgressed ancestry is tracked at all loci and at the 500 DMI loci where the introgressed allele is incompatible. Can toggle between human and D. melanogaster recombination maps.
