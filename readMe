This repository contains code for the paper: 
"Recombination and selection against introgressed DNA"
C Veller, NB Edelman, P Muralidhar, MA Nowak

The simulations in the paper were run in SLiM 3 (messerlab.org/slim), but the code has been updated so that it is compatible with SLiM 4 (these updates are administrative only).

Recombination rates are input from the .txt files in the folder "LinkageMaps". These recombination rates are interpolated from the linkage maps produced by Kong et al. 2010 (doi.org/10.1038/nature09525) for humans and Comeron et al. 2012 (doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002905) for Drosophila melanogaster.

"additiveSelection_Autosomal_noNeutralLoci.slim" is the baseline code, which simulates ....

"additiveSelection_Autosomal_withNeutralLoci.slim" adds to this baseline setup 10,000 neutral loci evenly spaced along the physical genome, and tracks ancestry at both these and the selected loci.
